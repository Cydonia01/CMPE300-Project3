To run the `main.py` file, use one of the following commands:
- `py main.py`
- `python3 main.py`
- `python main.py`

After running the file, you will be prompted to enter the data size, k value, and input type. Once entered, a file named `output-{datasize}-{inputtype}-{kvalue}.txt` will be created. This file contains the necessary outputs (which are also pasted into the AS1 word file).

The `main.py` file will continue to take input until you enter `exit`.

To generate all 27 possible outputs, run the `run.py` file.
